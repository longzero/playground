    <p class="">We love and respect all people. We stand behind the principle that we are all interconnected, and that behind every product, there’s a person. We love to know every person involved in each link of our production chain. We treat them as we would wish to be treated ourselves. We wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if we knew our products were created at the expense of victimized people. We also have a commitment to purchase core products  from independent local suppliers. </p>

    <p class="">Second only to oil, the textile industry is the worst culprit in global pollution. Clothing is filled with harmful chemical products that are detrimental to both our health and our environment. Our precious earth has zero need for any more pollutants. Our leggings are made up of 80% recycled plastic bottles and dyed using the solvent-free, non-toxic, sublimation printing process. Our line of basics is created with highly eco-friendly natural fibers, such as organic cotton and Tencel.</p>

    <p class="">Did you know that every year in North America, 81 pounds of textiles per person end up in the landfill?</p>
    <p class="">For this reason, we have chosen to create long-lasting products that will never go out of style. To reduce our environmental print, we plant trees all around Canada with every purchase, thanks to our amazing collaboration with <strong class="">Trees Canada</strong>.</p>

    <p class="">Our team works directly with manufacturers, garment makers, printers and knitters to create a product that will not harm our environment. Damage control translates into minimal water, pesticides and chemicals in our dyes. Eco also means zero waste. This is why at Rose Buddha, our Second Chance Jewel Collection revitalizes “unusable” scraps to give fabrics a second chance at life. Let’s transform our garbage into joy.</p>

  <h2 class="">Our Manifesto</h2>
  <p class="">When you open your closet, do you find yourself bombarded with clothes, but with nothing to wear? Are all the tags marked “Made in China” or “Made in Bangladesh?” Is just about everything pilled and falling apart, and sewn out of fabrics whose origins and composition we continue to ignore?</p>
  <p class=""><strong class="">We are all in the same boat</strong>, stuck in an industry that pressures us to consume more and more at an increasingly faster rate.</p>
  <p class="">The cycle forces us to renew our wardrobe constantly. To keep up with this pace, we’re confined to the cheapest options. It has become imperative that we shift our paradigm and learn how our clothes are made and where they come from.</p>
  <p class=""><strong class="">Sustainability. Ethics. Transparency.
  Why not bring these words back into fashion?</strong></p>
  <p class="">We’re fed up with clothing that’s made under problematic conditions that require our brothers and sisters to be treated like animals. To follow the latest trends, we have to endlessly revamp our closets, and we don’t want to pay top dollar over and over again. That’s enough. From the very first stitch to the final product, we’re asking for transparency.</p>
  <p class="">Disposable fashion entails a high <strong class="">human cost</strong>. Our environment also pays an enormous price.</p>
  <p class="">We know that our planet is racing to its end. We pollute, claiming there’s nothing to be done. In a world where everyone says it’s too late, we’re asking for transparency. <strong class="">We’re asking for a cleaner industry, one that respects its people.</strong></p>
  <p class="">To do so, we each have a big role to play. By getting informed, we can become conscious consumers. We have the power to create a shift by changing a few of our habits. At RB, we’re proposing an alternative to an industry that no longer reflects our values.</p>
  <p class="">We’ve given you the choice to fill your closets with eco-responsible clothing that’s made with respect for others.</p>
  <p class=""><strong class="">Join RB’s movement toward a responsible and respectful industry.</strong></p>
